<h2>Discovery of the Tablets.</h2>

<p>The baked clay tablets and portions of tablets which describe the
views and beliefs of the Babylonians and Assyrians about the Creation
were discovered by Mr. (later Sir) A.H. Layard, Mormuzd Rassam and
George Smith, Assistant in the Department of Oriental Antiquities in
the British Museum. They were found among the ruins of the Palace and
Library of Ashur-bani-pal (B.C. 668-626) at K&#x0323;uyûnjik&#x0323; (Nineveh),
between the years 1848 and 1876. Between 1866 and 1870, the great
"find" of tablets and fragments, some 20,000 in number, which Rassam
made in 1852, was worked through by George Smith, who identified many
of the historical inscriptions of Shalmaneser II, Tiglath-Pileser III,
Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and other kings mentioned in the
Bible, and several literary compositions of a legendary character,
fables, etc. In the course of this work he discovered fragments of
various versions of the Babylonian Legend of the Deluge, and portions
of several texts belonging to a work which treated of the beginning of
things, and of the Creation. In 1870, Rawlinson and Smith noted
allusions to the Creation in the important tablet K.63, but the texts
of portions of tablets of the Creation Series at that time available
for study were so fragmentary that it was impossible for these
scholars to find their correct sequence. During the excavations which
Smith carried out at K&#x0323;uyûnjik&#x0323; in 1873 and 1874 for the proprietors of
the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and the Trustees of the British Museum, he
was, he tells us, fortunate enough to discover "several fragments of
the Genesis Legends." In January, 1875, he made an exhaustive search
among the tablets in the British Museum, and in the following March he
published, in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> (March 4th), a summary of the
contents of about twenty fragments of the series of tablets describing
the creation of the heavens and the earth. In November of the same
year he communicated to the Society of Biblical Archaeology<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>
copies of:--(1) the texts on fragments of the First and Fifth Tablets
of Creation; (2) a text describing the fight between the "Gods and
Chaos"; and (3) a fragmentary text which, he believed, described the
Fall of Man. In the following year he published translations of all
the known fragments of the Babylonian Creation Legends in his
"Chaldean Account of Genesis" (London, 1876, 8vo, with photographs).
In this volume were included translations of the Exploits of Gizdubar
(Gilgamish), and some early Babylonian fables and legends of the gods.</p>


<h2>Publication of the Creation Tablets.</h2>

<p>The publication of the above-mentioned texts and translations proved
beyond all doubt the correctness of Rawlinson's assertion made in
1865, that "certain portions of the Babylonian and Assyrian Legends of
the Creation resembled passages in the early chapters of the Book of
Genesis."  During the next twenty years, the Creation texts were
copied and recopied by many Assyriologists, but no publication
appeared in which all the material available for reconstructing the
Legend was given in a collected form. In 1898, the Trustees of the
British Museum ordered the publication of all the Creation texts
contained in the Babylonian and Assyrian Collections, and the late
Mr. L. W. King, Assistant in the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian
Antiquities, was directed to prepare an edition. The exhaustive
preparatory search which he made through the collections of tablets in
the British Museum resulted in the discovery of many unpublished
fragments of the Creation Legends, and in the identification of a
fragment which, although used by George Smith, had been lost sight of
for about twenty-five years. He ascertained also that, according to
the Ninevite scribes, the Tablets of the Creation Series were seven in
number, and what several versions of the Legend of the Creation, the
works of Babylonian and Assyrian editors of different periods, must
have existed in early Mesopotamian Libraries. King's edition of the
Creation Texts appeared in "Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets in
the British Museum," Part XIII, London, 1901. As the scope of this
work did not permit the inclusion of his translations, and commentary
and notes, he published these in a private work entitled, "The Seven
Tablets of Creation, or the Babylonian and Assyrian Legends concerning
the creation of the world and of mankind," London, 1902, 8vo. A
supplementary volume contained much new material which had been found
by him since the appearance of the official edition of the texts, and
in fact doubled the number of Creation Texts known hitherto.</p>

<h2>The Object of the babylonian Legend of the Creation.</h2>

<p>A perusal of the texts of the Seven Tablets of Creation, which King
was enabled, through the information contained in them, to arrange for
the first time in their proper sequence, shows that the main object of
the Legend was the glorification of the god Marduk, the son of Ea
(Enki), as the conqueror of the dragon Tiâmat, and not the narration
of the story of the creation of the heavens, and earth and man. The
Creation properly speaking, is only mentioned as an exploit of Marduk
in the Sixth Tablet, and the Seventh Tablet is devoted wholly to the
enumeration of the honorific titles of Marduk. It is probable that
every great city in Babylonia, whilst accepting the general form of
the Creation Legend, made the greatest of its local gods the hero of
it. It has long been surmised that the prominence of Marduk in the
Legend was due to the political importance of the city of Babylon. And
we now know from the fragments of tablets which have been excavated in
recent years by German Assyriologists at K&#x0323;al'at Shark&#x0323;ât (or Shargat,
or Shar'at), that in the city of Ashur, the god Ashur, the national
god of Assyria, actually occupied in texts<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> of the Legend in use
there the position which Marduk held in four of the Legends current in
Babylonia. There is reason for thinking that the original hero of the
Legend was Enlil (Bel), the great god of Nippur (the Nafar, or Nufar
of the Arab writers), and that when Babylon rose into power under the
First Dynasty (about B.C. 2300), his position in the Legend was
usurped at Babylon by Marduk.</p>

<h2>Variant Forms of the Babylonian Legend of the Creation.</h2>

<p>The views about the Creation which are described in the Seven Tablets
mentioned above were not the only ones current in Mesopotamia, and
certainly they were not necessarily the most orthodox. Though in the
version of the Legend already referred to the great god of creation
was Enlil, or Marduk, or Ashur, we know that in the Legend of
Gilgamish (Second Tablet) it was the goddess Aruru who created Enkidu
(Eabani) from a piece of clay moistened with her own spittle. And in
the so-called "bilingual" version<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> of the Legend, we find that this
goddess assisted Marduk as an equal in the work of creating the seed
of mankind. This version, although Marduk holds the position of
pre-eminence, differs in many particulars from that given by the Seven
Tablets, and as it is the most important of all the texts which deal
directly with the creation of the heavens and the earth, a rendering
of it is here given.</p>

<h2>The Legend of the Creation According to Berosus and Damascius.</h2>

<p>Versions in Greek of the Legends found by George Smith had long been
known to classical scholars, owing to the preservation of fragments of
them in the works of later Greek writers, <i>e.g.</i>, Eusebius,
Syncellus, and others. The most important of these is derived from the
History of Babylonia, which was written in Greek by BEROSUS, a priest
of Bel-Marduk, <i>i.e.</i>, the "Lord Marduk," at Babylon, about 250
B.C.  In this work Berosus reproduced all the known historical facts
and traditions derived from native sources which were current in his
day. It is therefore not surprising to find that his account of the
Babylonian beliefs about the origin of things corresponds very closely
with that given in the cuneiform texts, and that it is of the greatest
use in explaining and partly in expanding these texts. His account of
the primeval abyss, out of which everything came, and of its
inhabitants reads:--</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/006.png" alt="" /><br />
Babylonian Monster. [No. 108,979.]</p>

<p>"There was a time in which there existed nothing but darkness and an
abyss of waters, wherein resided most hideous beings, which were
produced on a two-fold principle. There appeared men, some of whom
were furnished with two wings, others with four, and with two
faces. They had one body but two heads; the one that of a man, the
other of a woman; and likewise in their several organs both male and
female. Other human figures were to be seen with the legs and horns of
goats; some had horses' feet; while others united the hind-quarters of
a horse with the body of a man, resembling in shape the hippo-centaurs.
Bulls likewise were bred there with the heads of men, and dogs with
four told bodies, terminated in their extremities with the tails of
fishes; horses also with the heads of dogs; men too and other animals,
with the heads and bodies of horses and the tails of fishes. In short,
there were creatures in which were combined the limbs of every species
of animals. In addition to these, fishes, reptiles, serpents, with
other monstrous animals, which assumed each other's shape and
countenance. Of all which were preserved delineations in the temple of
Belus at Babylon."</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/007.png" alt="" /><br />
Babylonian Demon. [No. 93,089.]</p>

<p align="center">[THE SLAUGHTER OF THE QUEEN OF THE ABYSS.]</p>

<p>"The person, who presided over them, was a woman named OMUROCA; which
in the Chaldean language is THALATTH; in Greek THALASSA, the sea; but
which might equally be interpreted the Moon. All things being in this
situation, Belus came, and cut the woman asunder: and of one half of
her he formed the earth, and of the other half the heavens; and at the
same time destroyed the animals within her. All this (he says) was an
allegorical description of nature."</p>

<p align="center">[THE CREATION OF MAN.]</p>

<p>"For, the whole universe consisting of moisture, and animals being
generated therein, the deity above-mentioned<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> took off his own head:
upon which the other gods mixed the blood, as it gushed out, with the
earth; and from whence were formed men. On this account it is that
they are rational and partake of divine knowledge."</p>

<p align="center">[BELUS CREATES THE UNIVERSE.]</p>

<p>"This Belus, by whom they signify Jupiter, divided the darkness, and
separated the Heavens from the Earth, and reduced the universe to
order. But the animals not being able to bear the prevalence of light,
died. Belus upon this, seeing a vast space unoccupied, though by
nature fruitful, commanded one<a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> of the gods to take off his head,
and to mix the blood with the earth; and from thence to form other men
and animals, which should be capable of bearing the air. Belus formed
also the stars, and the sun, and the moon, and the five planets. Such,
according to Polyhistor Alexander, is the account which Berosus gives
in his first book." (See Cory, <i>Ancient Fragments</i>, London, 1832,
pp. 24-26.)</p>

<p>In the sixth century of our era DAMASCIUS the SYRIAN, the last of the
Neo-Platonic philosophers, wrote in Greek in a work on the Doubts and
Solutions of the first Principles, in which he says: "But the
Babylonians, like the rest of the Barbarians, pass over in silence the
One principle of the Universe, and they conceive Two, TAUTHE and
APASON; making APASON the husband of TAUTHE, and denominating her the
mother of the gods. And from these proceeds an only-begotten son,
MOYMIS, which I conceive is no other than the Intelligible World
proceeding from the two principles. From these, also, another progeny
is derived, DACHE and DACHUS; and again, a third, KISSARE and ASSORUS,
from which last three others proceed, ANUS, and ILLINUS, and AUS. And
of AUS and DAUCE is born a son called Belus, who, they say, is the
fabricator of the world, the Demiurgus." (See Cory, <i>Ancient
Fragments</i>, London, 1832, p. 318.)</p>


<h2>The Seven Tablets of Creation. Description of Their Contents.</h2>

<p>In the beginning nothing whatever existed except APSÛ, which may be
described as a boundless, confused and disordered mass of watery
matter; how it came into being is unknown. Out of this mass there were
evolved two orders of beings, namely, demons and gods. The demons had
hideous forms, even as Berosus said, which were part animal, part
bird, part reptile and part human. The gods had wholly human forms,
and they represented the three layers of the comprehensible world,
that is to say, heaven or the sky, the atmosphere, and the
underworld. The atmosphere and the underworld together formed the
earth as opposed to the sky or heaven. The texts say that the first
two gods to be created were LAKHMU <img src="images/c007.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" /> and LAKHAMU
<img src="images/c008.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />. Their attributes cannot at present be described, but
they seem to represent two forms of primitive matter. They appear to
have had no existence in popular religion, and it has been thought
that they may be described as theological conceptions containing the
notions of matter and some of its attributes.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/008.png" alt="" /><br />

<p>After countless aeons had passed the gods ANSHAR <img src="images/c009.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" /> and
KISHAR <img src="images/c010.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" /> came into being; the former represents the "hosts
of heaven," and the latter the "hosts of earth."</p>

<p>After another long and indefinite period the independent gods of the
Babylonian pantheon came into being, <i>e.g.</i>, ANU <img src="images/c011.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />, EA <img src="images/c012.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />, who is
here called NUDIMMUD <img src="images/c013.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />, and others.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/009.png" alt="" /><br />

<p>As soon as the gods appeared in the universe "order" came into
being. When APSÛ, the personification of confusion and disorder of
every kind, saw this "order," he took counsel with his female
associate TIÂMAT <img src="images/c014.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" /> with the object of finding some means of
destroying the "way" <img src="images/c015.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" /> (<i>al-ka-at</i>) or "order" of the
gods.  Fortunately the Babylonians and Assyrians have supplied us with
representations of Tiâmat, and these show us what form ancient
tradition assigned to her. She is depicted as a ferocious monster with
wings and scales and terrible claws, and her body is sometimes that of
a huge serpent, and sometimes that of an animal. In the popular
imagination she represented all that was physically terrifying, and
foul, and abominable; she was nevertheless the mother of everything,
<a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> and was the possessor of the DUP SHIMATI or "TABLET OF DESTINIES"
<img src="images/c016.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />. No description of this Tablet or its contents is
available, but from its name we may assume that it was a sort of
Babylonian Book of Fate.<a href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> Theologically, Tiâmat represented to the
Babylonians the same state in the development of the universe as did
<i>tôhû wâ-bhôhû</i> (Genesis i. 2), <i>i.e.</i>, formlessness and
voidness, of primeval matter, to the Hebrews She is depicted both on
bas-reliefs and on cylinder seals in a form which associates her with
LABARTU, <a href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> a female devil that prowled about the desert at night
suckling wild animals but killing men. And it is tolerably certain
that she was the type, and symbol, and head of the whole community of
fiends, demons and devils.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/010.png" alt="" /><br />

<p>In the consultation which took place between APSÛ and TIÂMAT, their
messenger MU-UM-MU <img src="images/c019.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" /> took part; of the history and
attributes of this last-named god nothing is known. The result of the
consultation was that a long struggle began between the demons and the
gods, and it is clear that the object of the powers of darkness was to
destroy the light. The whole story of this struggle is the subject of
the Seven Tablets of Creation. The gods are deifications of the sun,
moon, planets and other stars, and APSÛ, or CHAOS, and his companions
the demons, are personifications of darkness, night and evil. The
story of the fight between them is nothing more nor less than a
picturesque allegory of natural phenomena. Similar descriptions are
found in the literatures of other primitive nations, and the story of
the great fight between Her-ur, the great god of heaven, and Set, the
great captain of the hosts of darkness, may be quoted as an example.
Set regarded the "order" which H&#x0323;er-ur was bringing into the universe
with the same dislike as that with which APSÛ contemplated the
beneficent work of Sin, the Moon-god, Shamash, the Sun-god, and their
brother gods. And the hostility of Set and his allies to the gods,
like that of Tiâmat and her allies, was everlasting.</p>

between Marduk (Bel) and the Dragon. Drawn from a
bas-relief from the Palace of Ashur-nasir-pal, King of Assyria,
885-860 B.C., at Nimrûd. [Nimrûd Gallery, Nos. 28 and 29.]</p>

<p>At this point a new Text fills a break in the First Tablet,
and describes the fight which took place between Nudimmud
or Ea, (the representative of the established "order" which
the rule of the gods had introduced into the domain of Apsû
and Tiâmat) and Apsû and his envoy Mummu. Ea went forth
to fight the powers of darkness and he conquered Apsû and
Mummu. The victory over Apsû, <i>i.e.</i>, the confused and
boundless mass of primeval water, represents the setting of
impassable boundaries to the waters that are on and under the
earth, <i>i.e.</i>, the formation of the Ocean. The exact details of
the conquest cannot be given, but we know that Ea was the
possessor of the "pure (or white, or holy) incantation" and

that he overcame Apsû and his envoy by the utterance of a
powerful spell. In the Egyptian Legend of Ra&#x0304; and A&#x0304;apep,
the monster is rendered spell-bound by the god H&#x0323;er-T&#x0323;uati,
who plays in it exactly the same part as Ea in the Babylonian
Legend.</p>

<p>When Tiâmat heard of Ea's victory over Apsû and Mummu
she was filled with fury, and determined to avenge the death
of Apsû, her husband.</p>

<p>The first act of TIÂMAT after the death of Apsû was to increase the
number of her allies. We know that a certain creature called
"UMMU-KHUBUR" <img src="images/c020.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" /> at once spawned a brood of devilish monsters
to help her in her fight against the gods. Nothing is known of the
origin or attributes of UMMU-KHUBUR, but some think she was a form of
TIÂMAT. Her brood probably consisted of personifications of mist, fog,
cloud, storm, whirlwinds and the blighting and destroying powers which
primitive man associated with the desert. An exact parallel of this
brood of devils is found in Egyptian mythology where the allies of Set

and A&#x0304;apep are called "Mesu bet&#x0323;shet" <img src="images/h001.png" alt="[Hieroglyphics]" /> <i>i.e.</i>,
"spawn of impotent revolt." They are depicted in the form of
serpents, and some of them became the "Nine Worms of A&#x0307;menti" that are
mentioned in the Book of the Dead (Chap. I<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>Not content with Ummu-Khubur's brood of devils, Tiâmat called the
stars and powers of the air to her aid, for she "set up" (1) the
Viper, (2) the Snake, (3) the god Lakhamu, (4) the Whirlwind, (5) the
ravening Dog, (6) the Scorpion-man, (7) the mighty Storm-wind, (8) the
Fish-man, and (9) the Horned Beast. These bore (10) the "merciless,
invincible weapon," and were under the command of (11) Kingu, whom
Tiâmat calls "her husband." Thus Tiâmat had Eleven mighty Helpers
besides the devils spawned by Ummu-Khubur.  We may note in passing
that some of the above-mentioned Helpers appear among the Twelve Signs
of the Zodiac which Marduk "set up" after his conquest of Tiâmat,
<i>e.g.</i>, the Scorpion-man, the Horned Beast, etc. This fact
suggests that the first Zodiac was "set up" by Tiâmat, who with her
Eleven Helpers formed the Twelve Signs; the association of evil with
certain stars may date from that period. That the Babylonians regarded
the primitive gods as powers of evil is clear from the fact that
Lakhamu, one of them, is enumerated among the allies of Tiâmat.</p>

<p>The helpers of Tiâmat were placed by her under the command of a god
called KINGU <img src="images/c021.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" /> who is TAMMUZ.  He was the counterpart, or
equivalent, of ANU, the Sky-god, in the kingdom of darkness, for it is
said in the text "Kingu was exalted and received the power of Anu,"
<i>i.e.</i>, he possessed the same power and attributes as Anu. When
Tiâmat appointed Kingu to be her captain, she recited over him a
certain spell or incantation, and then she gave him the TABLET OF
DESTINIES and fastened it to his breast, saying, "Whatsoever goeth
forth from thy mouth shall be established." Armed with all the magical
powers conferred upon him by this Tablet, and heartened by all the
laudatory epithets which his wife Tiâmat heaped upon him, Kingu went
forth at the head of his devils.</p>

<p>When Ea heard that Tiâmat had collected her forces and Was determined
to continue the fight against the gods which Apsû and Mummu had begun,
and that she had made her husband Kingu her champion, he was
"afflicted" and "sat in sorrow." He felt unable to renew the fight
against the powers of darkness, and he therefore went and reported the
new happenings to Anshar, representative of the "host of heaven," and
took counsel with him. When Anshar heard the matter he was greatly
disturbed in mind and bit his lips, for he saw that the real
difficulty was to find a worthy antagonist for Kingu and Tiâmat. A gap
in the text here prevents us from knowing exactly what Anshar said and
did, but the context suggests that he summoned Anu, the Sky-god, to
his assistance. Then, having given him certain instructions, he sent
him on an embassy to Tiâmat with the view of conciliating her. When
Anu reached the place where she was he found her in a very wrathful
state, and she was muttering angrily; Anu was so appalled at the sight
of her that he turned and fled. It is impossible at present to explain
this interlude, or to find any parallel to it in other ancient
Oriental literature.</p>

<p>When Anu reported his inability to deal with Tiâmat, a council of the
gods was called, and Ea induced his son, Marduk to be present. We next
find Anshar in converse with the god Marduk, who offers to act as the
champion of the gods and to fight Tiâmat and her allies. Marduk being
a form of the Sun-god, the greatest of all the powers of light, thus
becomes naturally the protagonist of the gods, and the adversary of
Tiâmat and her powers of darkness. Then Anshar summoned a great
council of the gods, who forthwith met in a place called
"Upshukkinaku" <img src="images/c022.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />, which may be described as the Babylonian
Olympus. It was all-important for Marduk to appear at the council of
the gods before he undertook his task, because it was necessary for
him to be formally recognised by them as their champion, and he needed
to be endowed by them with magical powers.  The primitive gods Lakhmu
and Lakhamu, and the Igigi <img src="images/c023.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" /> (or <img src="images/c024.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />), who
may be regarded as star-gods, were also summoned. A banquet was
prepared, and the gods attended, and having met and kissed each other
they sat down, and ate bread and drank hot and sweet sesame wine. The
fumes of the wine confused their senses, but they continued to drink,

and at length "their spirits were exalted." They appointed Marduk to
be their champion officially, and then they proceeded to invest him
with the power that would cause every command he spake to be followed
immediately by the effect which he intended it to produce. Next
Marduk, with the view of testing the new power which had been given
him, commanded a garment to disappear and it did so; and when he
commanded it to reappear it did so.</p>

<p>Then the gods saluted him as their king, and gave him the insignia of
royalty, namely, the sceptre, the throne and the <i>pala</i>,
<img src="images/c025.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />, whatever that may be. And as they handed to him these
things they commanded him to go and hack the body of Tiâmat in pieces,
and to scatter her blood to the winds. Thereupon Marduk began to arm
himself for the fight. He took a bow, a spear, and a club; he filled
his body full of fire and set the lightning before him. He took in his
hands a net wherewith to catch Tiâmat, and he placed the four winds
near it, to prevent her from escaping from it when he had snared
her. He created mighty winds and tempests to assist him, and grasped
the thunderbolt in his hand; and then, mounting upon the Storm, which
was drawn by four horses, he went out to meet and defeat Tiâmat. It
seems pretty certain that this description of the equipment of Marduk
was taken over from a very ancient account of the Fight with Tiâmat in
which the hero was Enlil, <i>i.e.</i>, the god of the air, or of the
region which lies between heaven and hell. Marduk approached and
looked upon the "Middle" or "Inside" or "Womb" of Tiâmat <a href="#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a>
<img src="images/c026.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />, and divined the plan of Kingu who had taken up his
place therein. In the Seventh Tablet (l. 108) Marduk is said to have
"entered into the middle of Tiâmat," and because he did so he is
called "Nibiru," <i>i.e.</i>, "he who entered in," and the "seizer of
the middle." What the words "middle of Tiâmat" meant to the Babylonian
we are not told, but it is clear that Marduk's entry into it was a
signal mark of the triumph of the god. When Kingu from the "middle of
Tiâmat" saw Marduk arrayed in his terrible panoply of war, he was
terrified and trembled, and staggered about and lost all control of
his legs; and at the mere sight of the god all the other fiends and
devils were smitten with fear and reduced to helplessness. Tiâmat saw
Marduk and began to revile him, and when he challenged her to battle
she flew into a rage and attempted to overthrow him by reciting an
incantation, thinking that her words of power would destroy his
strength. Her spell had no effect on the god, who at once cast his net
over her. At the same moment he made a gale of foul wind to blow on
her face, and entering through her mouth it filled her body; whilst
her body was distended he drove his spear into her, and Tiâmat split
asunder, and her womb fell out from it. Marduk leaped upon her body
and looked on her followers as they attempted to escape. But the Four
Winds which he had stationed round about Tiâmat made all their efforts
to flee of no effect. Marduk caught all the Eleven allies of Tiâmat in
his net, and he trampled upon them as they lay in it helpless. Marduk
then took the TABLET OF DESTINIES from Kingu's breast, and sealed it
with his seal and placed it on his own breast.</p>

<p>Then returning to the dead body of Tiâmat he smashed her skull with
his club and scattered her blood to the north wind, and as a reward
for his destruction of their terrible foe, he received gifts and
presents from the gods his fathers.</p>

<p>The text then goes on to say that Marduk "devised a cunning plan,"
<i>i.e.</i>, he determined to carry out a series of works of
creation. He split the body of Tiâmat into two parts; out of one half
he fashioned the dome of heaven, and out of the other he constructed
the abode of Nudimmud, or Ea, which he placed over against Apsu,
<i>i.e.</i>, the deep. He also formulated regulations concerning the
maintenance of the same. By this "cunning plan" Marduk deprived the
powers of darkness of the opportunity of repeating their revolt with
any chance of success. Having established the framework of his new
heaven and earth Marduk, acting as the celestial architect, set to
work to furnish them. In the first place he founded E-Sharra
<img src="images/c027.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />, or the mansion of heaven, and next he set apart and
arranged proper places for the old gods of the three realms--Anu, Bel
and Ea.</p>

(like <img src="images/h003.png" alt="[Illustration]" /> in Egyptian) may symbolize eternity. Above his

Venus. On a stand in front of the pavilion rests the disk of the Sun,
which is held in position by ropes grasped in the hands of two divine
beings who are supported by the roof of the pavilion. The pavilion of
the Sun-god stands on the Celestial Ocean, and the four small disks
indicate either the four cardinal points or the tops of the pillars of
the heavens. The three figures in front of the disk represent the high
priest of Shamash, the king (Nabu-aplu-iddina, about 870 B.C.) and an
attendant goddess.  [No. 91,000.]</p>

<p>The text of the Fifth Tablet, which would undoubtedly have supplied
details as to Marduk's arrangement and regulations for the sun, the
moon, the stars, and the Signs of the Zodiac in the heavens is
wanting. The prominence of the celestial bodies in the history of
creation is not to be wondered at, for the greater number of the
religious beliefs of the Babylonians are grouped round them. Moreover,
the science of astronomy had gone hand in hand with the superstition
of astrology in Mesopotamia from time immemorial; and at a very early
period the oldest gods of Babylonia were associated with the heavenly
bodies. Thus the Annunaki and the Igigi, who are bodies of deified
spirits, were identified with the stars of the northern and southern
heaven, respectively. And all the primitive goddesses coalesced and
were grouped to form the goddess Ishtar, who was identified with the
Evening and Morning Star, or Venus. The Babylonians believed that the
will of the gods was made known to men by the motions of the planets,
and that careful observation of them would enable the skilled seer to
recognize in the stars favourable and unfavourable portents. Such
observations, treated from a magical point of view, formed a huge mass
of literature which was being added to continually. From the nature of
the case this literature enshrined a very considerable number of facts
of pure astronomy, and as early as the period of the First Dynasty
(about 2000 B.C.), the Babylonians were able to calculate astronomical
events with considerable accuracy, and to reconcile the solar and

lunar years by the use of epagomenal months. They had by that time
formulated the existence of the Zodiac, and fixed the "stations" of
the moon, and the places of the planets with it; and they had
distinguished between the planets and the fixed stars. In the Fifth
Tablet of the Creation Series (l. 2) the Signs of the Zodiac are
called <i>Lumashi</i><a href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> <img src="images/c028.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />, but unfortunately no list
of their names is given in the context. Now these are supplied by the
little tablet (No. 77,821) of the Persian Period of which a
reproduction is here given. It has been referred to and discussed by
various scholars, and its importance is very great. The transcript of
the text, which is now published (see p. 68) for the first time, will
be acceptable to the students of the history of the Zodiac. Egyptian,
Greek, Syriac and Arabic astrological and astronomical texts all
associate with the Signs of the Zodiac twelve groups, each containing
three stars, which are commonly known as the "Thirty-six Dekans."<a href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a>

The text of line 4 of the Fifth Tablet of the Creation Series proves
that the Babylonians were acquainted with these groups of stars, for
we read that Marduk "set up for the twelve "months of the year three
stars apiece." In the List of Signs of the Zodiac here given, it will
be seen that each Sign is associated with a particular month.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/015.png" alt="" /><br />
Tablet inscribed with a list of the Signs of the
Zodiac. [No. 77,821.]</p>

<p>At a later period, say about 500 B.C., the Babylonians made some of
the gods regents of groups of stars, for Enlil ruled 33 stars, Anu 23
stars, and Ea 15 stars. They also possessed lists of the fixed stars,
and drew up tables of the times of their heliacal risings. Such lists
were probably based upon very ancient documents, and prove that the
astral element in Babylonian religion was very considerable.</p>

<p>The accompanying illustration, which is reproduced from the Boundary
Stone of Ritti-Marduk (Brit. Mus., No. 90,858), supplies much
information about the symbols of the gods, and of the Signs of the
Zodiac in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar I, King of Babylon, about 1120
B.C.. Thus in Register 1, we have the Star of Ishtar, the crescent of
the Moon-god Sin, and the disk of Shamash the Sun-god. In Reg. 2 are
three stands (?) surmounted by tiaras, which represent the gods Anu,
Enlil (Bel) and Ea respectively. In Reg. 3 are three altars (?) or
shrines (?) with a monster in Nos. 1 and 2. Over the first is the
lance of Marduk, over the second the mason's square of Nabû, and over
the third is the symbol of the goddess Ninkharsag, the Creatress. In
Reg. 4 are a standard with an animal's head, a sign of Ea; a
two-headed snake = the Twins; an unknown symbol with a horse's head,
and a bird, representative of Shuk&#x0323;amuna and Shumalia. In Reg. 5 are a
seated figure of the goddess Gula and the Scorpion-man; and in Reg. 6
are forked lightning, symbol of Adad, above a bull, the Tortoise,
symbol of Ea (?), the Scorpion of the goddess Ishkhara, and the Lamp
of Nusku, the Fire-god. Down the left-hand side is the serpent-god
representing the constellation of the Hydra.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/016.png" alt="[Illustration]" /></p>

<p>The mutilated text of the Fifth Tablet makes it impossible to gain
further details in connection with Marduk's work in arranging the
heavens. We are, however, justified in assuming that the gaps in it
contained statements about the grouping of the gods into triads. In
royal historical inscriptions the kings often invoke the gods in
threes, though they never call any one three a triad or trinity. It
seems as if this arrangement of gods in threes was assumed to be of
divine origin.  In the Fourth Tablet of Creation, one triad
"Anu-Bel-Ea" is actually mentioned, and in the Fifth Tablet, another
is indicated, "Sin-Shamash-Ishtar." In these triads Anu represents the
sky or heaven, Bel or Enlil the region under the sky and including the
earth, Ea the underworld, Sin the Moon, Shamash the Sun, and Ishtar
the star Venus. When the universe was finally constituted several
other great gods existed, <i>e.g.</i>, Nusku, the Fire-god, Enurta,<a href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a> a solar god, Nergal, the god of war and handicrafts, Nabu, the god
of learning, Marduk of Babylon, the great national god of Babylonia,
and Ashur, the great national god of Assyria.</p>

<p>When Marduk had arranged heaven and earth, and had established the
gods in their places, the gods complained that their existence was
barren, because they lacked worshippers at their shrines and
offerings. To make a way out of this difficulty Marduk devised another
"cunning plan," and announced his intention of creating man out of
"blood and bone" DAMI IS&#x0323;S&#x0323;IMTUM <img src="images/c029.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />. We have already quoted
(see p. 11) the statement of Berosus that man was created out of the
blood of a god mixed with earth; here, then, is the authority for his
words. Marduk made known to Ea his intention of creating man, and Ea
suggested that if one of the gods were sacrificed the remainder of
them should be set free from service, presumably to Marduk.  Thereupon
Marduk summons a council of the gods, and asks them to name the
instigator of the fight in which he himself was the victor. In reply
the gods named Kingu, Tiâmat's second husband, whom they seized
forthwith, and bound with fetters and carried to Ea, and then having
"inflicted punishment upon him they let his blood." From Kingu's blood
Ea fashioned mankind for the service of the gods.</p>

<p>Now among the texts which have been found on the tablets at K&#x0323;al'at
Shark&#x0323;ât is an account of the creation of man which differs from the
version given in the Seven Tablets of Creation, but has two features
in common with it. These two features are: (1) the council of the gods
to discuss the creation of man; (2) the sacrifice which the gods had
to make for the creation of man. In the variant version two (or more)
gods are sacrificed, <img src="images/c030.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />, <i>Ilu Nagar Ilu Nagar</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, "the workmen gods," about whom nothing is known. The
place of sacrifice is specified with some care, and it is said to be
"Uzu-mu-a, or the bond of heaven and earth." Uzu-mu-a may be the bolt
with which Marduk locked the two halves of Tiâmat into place.</p>

<p>The Anunnaki, wishing to give an expression of their admiration for
Marduk's heroism, decided to build him a shrine or temple. To this
Marduk agreed, and chose Babylon, <i>i.e.</i>, the "Gate of God," for
its site. The Anunnaki themselves made the bricks, and they built the
great temple of E-Sagila at Babylon. When the temple was finished,
Marduk re-enacted the scene of creation; for, as he had formerly
assigned to each god his place in the heavens, so now he assigned to
each god his place in E-Sagila. The tablet ends with a long hymn of
praise which the Anunnaki sang to Marduk, and describes the summoning
of an assembly of the gods to proclaim ceremonially the great Fifty
Names of this god. Thus the gods accepted the absolute supremacy of
Marduk.</p>

<p>From the above it is clear that a dispute broke out between Marduk and
the gods after he had created them, and the tradition of it has made
its way into the religious literatures of the Hebrews, Syrians, Arabs,
Copts and Abyssinians. The cuneiform texts tell us nothing about the
cause of the dispute, but tradition generally ascribes it to the
creation of man by the supreme God; and it is probable that all the
apocryphal stories which describe the expulsion from heaven of the
angels who contended against God under the leadership of Satan, or
Satnael, or Iblîs, are derived from a Babylonian original which has
not yet been found. The "Fifty Names," or laudatory epithets mentioned
above, find parallels in "Seventy-five Praises of Ra&#x0304;," sung by the
Egyptians under the XIXth dynasty,<a href="#fn15"><sup>15</sup></a> and in the "Ninety-nine
Beautiful Names of Allâh," which are held in such great esteem by the
Muh&#x0323;ammadans.<a href="#fn16"><sup>16</sup></a> The respect in which the Fifty Names were held by the
Babylonians is well shown by the work of the Epilogue on the Seventh
Tablet, where it is said, "Let them be held in remembrance, let the
first-comer (<i>i.e.</i>, any and every man) proclaim them; let the
wise and the understanding consider them together. Let the father
repeat them and teach them to his son. Let them be in the ears of the
herdsman and the shepherd."</p>

<p>The object of the writer of the Fifty Names was to show that Marduk
was the "Lord of the gods," that the power, qualities and attributes
of every god were enshrined in him, and that they all were merely
forms of him. This fact is proved by the tablet (No. 47,406),<a href="#fn17"><sup>17</sup></a>
which contains a long list of gods who are equated with Marduk in his
various forms.<a href="#fn18"><sup>18</sup></a> The tendency in the later Babylonian religion to
make Marduk the god above all gods has led many to think that
monotheistic conceptions were already in existence among the
Babylonians as early as the period of the First Dynasty, about 2000
B.C.  It is indisputable that Marduk obtained his pre-eminence in the
Babylonian Pantheon at this early period. But some authorities deny
the existence of monotheistic conceptions among the Babylonians at
that time, and attribute Marduk's kingship of the gods to the
influence of the political situation of the time, when Babylon first
became the capital of the country, and mistress of the greater part of
the known world.  Material for deciding this question is wanting, but
it may be safely said that whatever monotheistic conceptions existed
at that time, their acceptance was confined entirely to the priests
and scribes. They certainly find no expression in the popular
religious texts.</p>

<p>Both the source of the original form of the Legend of the Fight
between Ea and Apsu, and Marduk and Tiâmat, and the period of its
composition are unknown, but there is no doubt that in one form or
another it persisted in Mesopotamia for thousands of years. The
apocryphal book of "Bel and the Dragon" shows that a form of the
Legend was in existence among the Babylonian Jews long after the
Captivity, and the narrative relating to it associates it with
religious observances.  But there is no foundation whatsoever for the
assertion which has so often been made that the Two Accounts of the
Creation which are given in the early chapters in Genesis are derived
from the Seven Tablets of Creation described in the preceding
pages. It is true that there are many points of resemblance between
the narratives in cuneiform and Hebrew, and these often illustrate
each other, but the fundamental conceptions of the Babylonian and
Hebrew accounts are essentially different.  In the former the earliest
beings that existed were foul demons and devils, and the God of
Creation only appears at a later period, but in the latter the
conception of God is that of a Being Who existed in and from the
beginning, Almighty and Alone, and the devils of chaos and evil are
His servants.</p>

<p>Among the primitive Semitic peoples there were probably many versions
of the story of the Creation; and the narrative told by the Seven
Tablets is, no doubt, one of them in a comparatively modern form. It
is quite clear that the Account of the Creation given in the Seven
Tablets is derived from very ancient sources, and a considerable
amount of literary evidence is now available for reconstructing the
history of the Legend.  Thus in the Sumerian Account the narrative of
the exploits of the hero called ZIUSUDU<a href="#fn19"><sup>19</sup></a> <img src="images/c031.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" /> begins
with a description of the Creation and then goes on to describe a
Flood, and there is little doubt that certain passages in this text
are the originals of the Babylonian version as given in the Seven
Tablets. In the Story of ZIUSUDU, however, there is no mention of any
Dragon. And there is reason to think that the Legend of the Dragon had
originally nothing whatever to do with the Creation, for the texts of
fragments of two distinct Accounts<a href="#fn20"><sup>20</sup></a> of the Creation describe a
fight between a Dragon and some deity other than Marduk. In other
Accounts the Dragon bears a strong resemblance to the Leviathan of
Psalm civ, 26; Job xli, 1. In the one text he is said to be 50
<i>biru</i><a href="#fn21"><sup>21</sup></a> in length, and 1 <i>biru</i> in thickness; his mouth
was 6 cubits (about 9 feet) wide, and the circumference of his ears 12
cubits (18 feet). He was slain by a god whose name is unknown, and the
blood continued to flow from his body for three years, three months,
one day and one night.  In the second text the Dragon is 60
<i>biru</i> long and his thickness is 30 <i>biru</i>; the diameter of
each eye is half a <i>biru</i>, and his paws are 20 <i>biru</i>
long. Thus there is every reason for believing that the Legend as it
is given in the Seven Tablets is the work of some editor, who added
the Legend of the Creation to the Legend of the Dragon in much the
same way as the editor of the Gilgamish Legends included an account of
the Deluge in his narrative of the exploits of his hero. All forms of
the Legend of the Creation and of the Dragon were popular in
Babylonia, and one of them achieved so much notoriety that the priest
employed recited it as an incantation to charm away the toothache.</p>

<p>The literary form of the text of the Seven Tablets fulfils the
requirements of Semitic poetry in general. The lines usually fall into
couplets, the second line being the antiphon of the first,
<i>e.g.</i>:--</p>

<blockquote>"When in the height heaven was not named,<br />
And the earth beneath did not yet bear a name."</blockquote>

<p>Each line, or verse, falls into two halves, and a well-marked caesura
divides each line, or verse, into two equally accented parts. And the
half-lines can be further resolved into two halves, each containing a
single accented word or phrase. This is proved by tablet Spartali ii,
265A, where the scribe writes his lines and spaces the words in such a
way as to show the subdivision of the lines. Thus we have:--</p>

<table summary="" align="center">
<tr>
  <td><i>enuma</i></td>
  <td>| <i>elish</i></td>
  <td>|| <i>lâ nabû</i></td>
  <td>| <i>shamamu</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>shaplish</i></td>
  <td>| <i>ammatum</i></td>
  <td>|| <i>shuma</i></td>
  <td>| <i>lâ zakrat</i></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Here there is clearly a rhythm which resembles that found in the poems
of the Syrians and Arabs, but there are many instances of its
inconsistent use in several parts of the text.  Both rhyme and
alliteration appear to be used occasionally.</p>

<p>6. A field had not been measured, a marsh had not been searched out,</p>

<p>7. When of the gods none was shining,</p>

<p>8. A name had not been recorded, a fate had not been fixed,</p>

<p>9. The gods came into being in the midst of them.</p>

<p>10. The god Lakhmu and the goddess Lakhamu were made to shine, they
were named.</p>

<p>11. [Together] they increased in stature, they grew tall.</p>

<p>12. Anshar and Kishar came into being, and others besides them.</p>

<p>13. Long were the days, the years increased.</p>

<p>14. The god Anu, their son, the equal of his fathers, [was created].</p>

<p>15. The god Anshar made his eldest son Anu in his own image.</p>

<p>16. And the god Anu begat Nudimmud (Ea) the image of himself.</p>

<p>17. The god Nudimmud was the first among his fathers,</p>

<p>18. Endowed with understanding, he who thinketh deeply, the orator</p>

<p>19. Exceedingly mighty in strength above his father Anshar who begat
him.</p>

<p>20. Unrivalled amongst the gods his brothers ...</p>

<p>21. The confraternity of the gods was established.</p>

<p>22. Tiâmat was troubled and she ... their guardian.</p>

<p>23. Her belly was stirred up to its uttermost depths.</p>

<p>24. ...........</p>

<p>25. Apsu (the watery abyss) could not diminish their brawl</p>

<p>26. And Tiâmat gathered herself together ...</p>

<p>27. She struck a blow, and their works ...</p>

<p>28. Their way was not good,...</p>

<p>29. At that time Apsu, the progenitor of the great gods,</p>

<p>30. Shouted out and summoned Mummu, the steward of his house, saying</p>

<p>31. "[O] Mummu, my steward, who makest my liver to rejoice,</p>

<p>32. "Come, to Tiâmat we will go."</p>

<p>33. They went, they lay down [on a couch] facing Tiâmat.</p>

<p>34. They took counsel together about the gods [their children].</p>

<p>35. Apsu took up his word and said,</p>

<p>36. To Tiâmat, the holy (?) one, he made mention of a matter,
[saying],</p>

<p>37. "... their way ...</p>

<p>38. "By day I find no peace, by night I have no rest.</p>

<p>39. "Verily I will make an end of their way, I will sweep them away,</p>

<p>40. "There shall be a sound of lamentation; lo, then we shall rest."</p>

<p>41. Tiâmat on hearing this</p>

<p>42. Was stirred up to wrath and shrieked to her husband,<a href="#fn24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>43. ... unto sickness. She raged all alone,</p>

<p>44. She uttered a curse, and unto [Apsu, spake, saying,],</p>

<p>45. "Whatsoever we have made we will destroy.</p>

<p>46. "Verily their way shall be filled with disaster; lo, then we shall
rest."</p>

<p>47. Mummu answered and gave counsel unto Apsu,</p>

<p>48. The counsel of Mummu was ... and dire [in respect of the gods]:</p>

<p>49. "Come, [do thou destroy] their way which is strong.</p>

<p>50. "Then verily by day thou shalt find peace, [and] by night thou
shalt have rest."</p>

<p>51. Apsu heard him, his face grew bright,</p>

<p>52. For that they were planning evil against the gods, his children.</p>

<p>53. Mummu embraced his neck ...</p>

<p>54. He took him on his knee, he kissed him ...</p>

<p>55. They (<i>i.e.</i> Mummu and Apsu) planned the cursing in the
assembly,</p>

<p>56. They repeated the curses to the gods their eldest sons.</p>

<p>57. The gods made answer ...</p>

<p>58. They began a lamentation...</p>

<p>59. [Endowed] with understanding, the prudent god, the exalted one,</p>

<p>60. Ea, who pondereth everything that is, searched out their [plan].</p>

<p>61. He brought it to nought (?), he made the form of everything to
stand still.</p>

<p>62. He recited a cunning incantation, very powerful and holy.</p>

<p>[In the British Museum tablets lines 63-108 are either wanting
entirely, or are too broken to translate, and the last 130 lines of
the Berlin fragment are much mutilated. The fragments of text show
that Ea waged war against Apsu and Mummu. Ea recited an incantation
which caused Apsu to fall asleep. He then "loosed the joints" of
Mummu, who in some way suffered, but he was strong enough to attack Ea
when he turned to deal with Apsu. Ea overcame both his adversaries and
divided Apsu into chambers and laid fetters upon him.  In one of the
chambers of Apsu a god was begotten and born.  According to the
Ninevite theologians Ea begat by his wife, who is not named, his son
Marduk, and according to the theologians of the City of Ashur, Lakhmu
begat by his wife Lakhamu a son who is no other than Anshar, or
Ashur. A nurse was appointed to rear him, and he grew up a handsome
child, to the great delight of his father. He had four ears and four
eyes, a statement which suggests that he was two-headed, and resembled
the Latin god Janus.]</p>

<p>109. They formed a band, and went forth to battle to help Tiâmat.</p>

<p>110. They were exceedingly wroth, they made plots by day and by night
without ceasing.</p>

<p>111. They offered battle, fuming and raging.</p>

<p>112. They set the battle in array, they uttered cries<a href="#fn25"><sup>25</sup></a> of hostility,</p>

<p>113. Ummu-Khubur,<a href="#fn26"><sup>26</sup></a> who fashioned all things,</p>

<p>114. Set up the unrivalled weapon, she spawned huge serpents,</p>

<p>115. Sharp of tooth, pitiless in attack (?)</p>

<p>116. She filled their bodies with venom instead of blood,</p>

<p>117. Grim, monstrous serpents, arrayed in terror,</p>

<p>118. She decked them with brightness, she fashioned them in exalted
forms,</p>

<p>119. So that fright and horror might overcome him that looked upon
them,</p>

<p>120. So that their bodies might rear up, and no man resist their
attack,</p>

<p>121. She set up the Viper, and the Snake, and the god Lakhamu,</p>

<p>122. The Whirlwind, the ravening Dog, the Scorpion-man,</p>

<p>123. The mighty Storm-wind, the Fish-man, the horned Beast
(Capricorn?)</p>

<p>124. They carried the Weapon<a href="#fn27"><sup>27</sup></a> which spared not, nor flinched from
the battle.</p>

<p>125. Most mighty were Tiâmat's decrees, they could not be resisted,</p>

<p>126. Thus she caused eleven [monsters] of this kind to come into
being,</p>

<p>127. Among the gods, her first-born son who had collected her company,</p>

<p>128. That is to say, Kingu, she set on high, she made him the great
one amongst them,</p>

<p>129. Leader of the hosts in battle, disposer of the troops,</p>

<p>130. Bearer of the firmly grasped weapon, attacker in the fight,</p>

<p>131. He who in the battle is the master of the weapon,</p>

<p>132. She appointed, she made him to sit down in [goodly apparel]</p>

<p>133. [Saying], "I have uttered the incantation for thee. I have
magnified thee in the assembly of the gods.</p>

<p>134. "I have filled his [<i>sic</i>, read 'thy'] hand with the
sovereignty of the whole company of the gods.</p>

<p>135. "Mayest thou be magnified, thou who art my only spouse,</p>

<p>136. "May the Anunnaki make great thy renown over all of them."</p>

<p>137. She gave him the TABLET OF DESTINIES, she fastened it on his
breast, [saying],</p>

<p>138. "As for thee, thy command shall not fall empty, whatsoever goeth
forth from thy mouth shall be established."</p>

<p>139. When Kingu was raised on high and had taken the heavens
(literally, the god Anutum)</p>

<p>140. He fixed the destinies for the gods his sons,</p>

<p>141. Open your mouths, let the Fire-god<a href="#fn28"><sup>28</sup></a> be quenched,</p>

<p>142. He who is glorious in battle and is most mighty, shall do great
deeds.</p>

<p>45. When Kingu was raised on high and had taken the heavens

46. He fixed the destinies for the gods his sons, [saying],</p>

<p>47. "Open your mouths, let the Fire-god be quenched,</p>

<p>51. ... his mind was not at peace</p>

<p>[Lines 52-54 too fragmentary for translation.]</p>

<p>An'shar then addresses Ea and says:--</p>

<p>[Lines 57 and 58 imperfect; lines 59-71 wanting.]</p>

<p>79. [Anu] heard the order of his father Anshar.</p>

<p>80. He took the straight road to her, and hastened on the way to her.</p>

<p>81. Anu drew nigh, he searched out the plan of Tiâmat,</p>

<p>82. He could not prevail against her, he turned back.</p>

<p>Lines 83 and 84 contain Anu's report to Anshar, but they are too
fragmentary to translate; line 85 reads:--</p>

<p>83. He (Anu) went to his father Anshar who begat him,</p>

<p>86. Anshar was distressed, he looked down upon the ground,</p>

<p>87. He turned pale; towards Ea he lifted up his head.</p>

<p>88. All the Anunnaki assembled at their posts.</p>

<p>89. They shut their mouths, they sat in lamentation.</p>

<p>90. [They said], "Nowhere is there a god who can attack Tiâmat.</p>

<p>91. "He would not escape from Tiâmat's presence with his life."</p>

<p>92. The Lord Anshar, the Father of the gods, [spake] majestically,</p>

<p>93. He lifted up his heart, he addressed the Anunnaki, [saying]</p>

<p>94. "He whose [strength] is mighty [shall be] an avenger for [us]</p>

<p>115. Anshar looked upon him and his heart was filled with gladness.</p>

<p>116. He (<i>i.e.</i>, Anshar) kissed his (Marduk's) lips, and his
(Anshar's) fear was removed. [Then Marduk said]</p>

<p>73. "Mother Tiâmat who gave us birth hath sown these things,</p>

<p>74. "She hath set in order her assembly, she rageth furiously.</p>

<p>75. "All the gods have joined themselves to her.</p>

<p>76. "They march by her side together with those whom ye have created,</p>

<p>77. "They formed a band and went forth to battle to help Tiâmat.</p>

<p>78. "They were exceedingly wroth, they made plans by day and by night
without ceasing.</p>

<p>79. "They offered battle, foaming and raging.</p>

<p>80. "They set the battle in array, they uttered cries of defiance.</p>

<p>81. "Ummu-Khubur, who formed all things,</p>

<p>82. "Set up the unrivalled weapon, she spawned huge serpents,</p>

<p>83. "Sharp of tooth, pitiless in attack (?)</p>

<p>86. "She decked them with brightness, she fashioned them in exalted
forms,</p>

<p>87. "So that fright and horror might overcome him that looked upon
them,</p>

<p>88. "So that their bodies might rear up, and no man resist their
attack.</p>

<p>89. "She set up the Viper, and the Snake, and the god Lakhamu,</p>

<p>90. "The Whirlwind, the Ravening Dog, the Scorpion-man,</p>

battle.</p>

<p>123. "Hasten ye therefore, issue your decrees speedily</p>

<p>124. "That he may go to meet your mighty enemy."</p>

<p>125. The gods Lakhmu and Lakhamu heard, they wailed loudly,</p>

<p>126. All the Igigi gods wept bitterly [saying]:</p>

<p>127. "Who were [our] enemies until [the gods] were posted [in heaven]?</p>

<p>128. "We cannot comprehend the work of Tiâmat."</p>

<p>129. They gathered themselves together, they went,</p>

<p>130. All the great gods, who issue decrees.</p>

<p>131. They entered in, they filled [the court] before Anshar.</p>

<p>132. Brother [god] kissed brother [god] in the [divine] assembly,</p>

<p>133. They held a meeting, they sat down to a feast,</p>

<p>134. They ate bread, they heated the [sesame wine],</p>

<p>135. The taste of the sweet drink confused their ...</p>

<p>136. They drank themselves drunk, their bodies were filled to
overflowing,</p>

<p>137. They were overcome by heaviness [of drink], their livers
(<i>i.e.</i>, spirits) were exalted,</p>

<p>138. They issued the decree for Marduk as their avenger.</p>

<h3>FOURTH TABLET.</h3>

<p>1. They founded for him a majestic canopy,</p>

<p>2. He (<i>i.e.</i>, Marduk) seated himself in the seat of kingship in
the presence of his fathers [who said unto him]:</p>

<p>3. "Thou art honourable by reason of thy greatness among the gods.</p>

<p>4. "Thy position is unrivalled, the words thou utterest become Anum
(<i>i.e.</i>, as fixed as the sky).</p>

<p>5. "Thou art honourable by reason of thy greatness among the gods.</p>

<p>6. "Thy position is unrivalled, the words thou utterest become Anum
(<i>i.e.</i>, as fixed as the sky).</p>

<p>7. "From this day onward thy command shall not be abrogated.</p>

<p>8. "The power to exalt to heaven and to cast down to the earth both
shall be in thy hand,</p>

<p>9. "That which goeth forth from thy mouth shall be established,
against thy utterance shall be no appeal.</p>

<p>10. "No one among the gods shall overstep thy boundary,</p>

<p>11. "Worship, which is the object of the sanctuary of the gods,</p>

<p>12. "Whensoever they lack [it] shall be forthcoming in thy sanctuary,</p>

<p>13. "O god Marduk, thou art our avenger.</p>

<p>14. "We have given unto thee sovereignty over the whole creation,</p>

<p>15. "Thou shalt sit down, in the council thy word shall be exalted,</p>

<p>16. "Thy weapon shall never fall [from thy hands], it shall break the
head of thy foe.</p>

<p>17. "Lord, whosoever putteth his trust in thee, spare thou his life,</p>

<p>18. "And the god who deviseth evil, pour thou out his soul."</p>

<p>19. Then a cloak (literally, one cloak) was set in their midst,</p>

<p>20. They addressed the god Marduk their first-born [saying]:</p>

<p>21. "Thou, Lord, shalt hold the foremost position among the gods.</p>

<p>22. "Decree thou the throwing down<a href="#fn32"><sup>32</sup></a> and the building up,<a href="#fn33"><sup>33</sup></a> and it
shall come to pass.</p>

<p>23. "Speak but the word, and the cloak shall disappear,</p>

<p>24. "Speak a second time and the cloak shall return uninjured."</p>

<p>25. Marduk spoke the word, the cloak disappeared,</p>

<p>26. He spoke a second time, the cloak reappeared.</p>

<p>27. When the gods his fathers saw the issue of the utterance of his
mouth</p>

<p>28. They rejoiced and adored [him, saying], "Marduk is King."</p>

<p>29. They conferred upon him the sceptre, the throne, and the symbol of
royalty (?)<a href="#fn34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>30. They gave him the unrivalled weapon, the destroyer of the enemy
[saying]:</p>

<p>31. "Go, cut off the life of Tiâmat.</p>

<p>32. "Let the wind carry her blood into the depth [under the earth]."</p>

<p>33. The gods, his fathers, issued the decree for the god Bel.</p>

<p>34. They set him on the road which leadeth to peace and adoration.</p>

<p>35. He strung [his] bow, he set ready his weapon [in the stand],</p>

<p>36. He slung his spear, he attached it to [his belly],</p>

<p>37. He raised the club, he grasped it in his right hand.</p>

<p>38. The bow and the quiver he hung at his side.<a href="#fn35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>39. He set the lightning in front of him.</p>

<p>40. His body was filled with a glancing flame of fire.</p>

<p>41. He made a net wherewith to enclose Tiâmat.</p>

<p>42. He made the four winds to take up their position so that no part
of her might escape,</p>

<p>43. The South wind, the North wind, the East wind, the West wind.</p>

<p>44. He held the net close to his side, the gift of his father Anu,</p>

<p>45. He created the "foul" wind, the storm, the parching blast,</p>

<p>46. The wind of "four," the wind of "seven," the typhoon, the wind
incomparable</p>

<p>47. He despatched the seven winds which he had made,</p>

<p>48. To make turbid the inward parts of Tiâmat; they followed in his
train.</p>

<p>49. The Lord raised up the wind storm, his mighty weapon.</p>

<p>50. He went up into his chariot, the unequalled and terrible
tempest.<a href="#fn36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>51. He equipped it, he yoked thereto a team of four horses,</p>

<p>52. Pawing the ground, champing, foaming [eager to] fly,</p>

<p>53. ... [the odour] of their teeth bore foetidness,</p>

<p>54. They were skilled [in biting], they were trained to trample under
foot.</p>

<p>[Lines 55-57 too fragmentary to translate; they continue the
description of Marduk's equipment.]</p>

<p>58. His brightness streamed forth, his head was crowned [thereby].</p>

<p>59. He took a direct path, he hastened on his journey.</p>

<p>60. He set his face towards the place of Tiâmat, who was ...</p>

<p>61. On his lips ... he restrained</p>

<p>62. ... his hand grasped.</p>

<p>63. At that moment the gods were gazing upon him with fixed intensity,</p>

<p>64. The gods, his fathers, gazed upon him, they gazed upon him.</p>

<p>65. The Lord approached, he looked upon the middle of Tiâmat,</p>

<p>66. He searched out the plan of Kingu, her husband.</p>

<p>67. Marduk looked, Kingu staggered in his gait,</p>

<p>68. His will was destroyed, his motion was paralysed.</p>

<p>69. And the gods his helpers who were marching by his side</p>

<p>70. Saw the [collapse of] their chief and their sight was troubled.</p>

<p>71. Tiâmat [shrieked but] did not turn her head.</p>

<p>72. With lips full of [rebellious words] she maintained her
stubbornness</p>

<p>73. [Saying], "... that thou hast come as the Lord of the gods,
[forsooth],</p>

<p>74. "They have appointed thee in the place which should be theirs."</p>

<p>75. The Lord raised up the wind-storm, his mighty weapon,</p>

<p>76. [Against] Tiâmat, who was furious (?), he sent it, [saying]:</p>

<p>77. "[Thou hast made thyself] mighty, thou art puffed upon high,</p>

<p>78. "Thy heart [hath stirred thee up] to invoke battle</p>

<p>79. "... their fathers ...</p>

<p>80. "...</p>

<p>81. "[Thou hast exalted Kingu to be [thy] husband,</p>

<p>82. "[Thou hast made him to usurp] the attributes of Anu</p>

<p>83. "... thou hast planned evil.</p>

<p>84. "[Against] the gods, my fathers, thou hast wrought evil.</p>

<p>85. "Let now thy troops gird themselves up, let them bind on their
weapons.</p>

<p>86. "Stand up! Thou and I, let us to the fight!"</p>

<p>87. On hearing these words Tiâmat</p>

<p>88. Became like a mad thing, her senses became distraught,</p>

<p>89. Tiâmat uttered shrill cries again and again.</p>

<p>90. That on which she stood split in twain at the words,</p>

<p>91. She recited an incantation, she pronounced her spell.</p>

<p>92. The gods of battle demanded their weapons.<a href="#fn37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>93. Tiâmat and Marduk, the envoy of the gods, roused themselves,</p>

<p>94. They advanced to fight each other, they drew nigh in battle.</p>

<p>95. The Lord cast his net and made it to enclose her,</p>

<p>96. The evil wind that had its place behind him he let out in her
face.</p>

<p>97. Tiâmat opened her mouth to its greatest extent,</p>

<p>98. Marduk made the evil wind to enter [it] whilst her lips were
unclosed.</p>

<p>99. The raging winds filled out her belly,</p>

<p>100. Her heart was gripped, she opened wide her mouth [panting].</p>

<p>101. Marduk grasped the spear, he split up her belly,</p>

<p>102. He clave open her bowels, he pierced [her] heart,</p>

<p>103. He brought her to nought, he destroyed her life.</p>

<p>104. He cast down her carcase, he took up his stand upon it,</p>

<p>105. After Marduk had slain Tiâmat the chief,</p>

<p>106. Her host was scattered, her levies became fugitive,</p>

<p>107. And the gods, her allies, who had marched at her side,</p>

<p>108. Quaked with terror, and broke and ran</p>

<p>109. And betook themselves to flight to save their lives.</p>

<p>110. But they found themselves hemmed in, they could not escape,</p>

<p>111. Marduk tied them up, he smashed their weapons.</p>

<p>112. They were cast into the net, and they were caught in the snare,</p>

<p>113. The ... of the world they filled with [their] cries of grief.</p>

<p>114. They received [Marduk's] chastisement, they were confined in
restraint,</p>

<p>115. And [on] the Eleven Creatures which Tiâmat had filled with
awfulness,</p>

<p>116. The company of the devils that marched at her ...</p>

<p>117. He threw fetters, he ... their sides.</p>

<p>118. They and their resistance he trod under his feet.</p>

<p>119. The god Kingu who had been magnified over them</p>

<p>120. He crushed, he esteemed him [as little worth] as the god Dugga,
(as a dead god?).</p>

<p>121. Marduk took from him the TABLET OF DESTINIES, which should never
have been his,</p>

<p>122. He sealed it with a seal<a href="#fn38"><sup>38</sup></a> and fastened it on his breast</p>

<p>123. After he had crushed and overthrown his enemies,</p>

<p>124. He made the haughty enemy to be like the dust underfoot.</p>

<p>125. He established completely Anshar's victory over the enemy,</p>

<p>126. The valiant Marduk achieved the object of Nudimmud (Ea),<a href="#fn39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>127. He imposed strict restraint on the gods whom he had made captive.</p>

<p>128. He turned back to Tiâmat whom he had defeated,</p>

<p>129. The Lord [Marduk] trampled on the rump of Tiâmat,</p>

<p>130. With his unsparing club he clave her skull.</p>

<p>131. He slit open the channels (<i>i.e.</i>, arteries) of her blood.</p>

<p>132. He caused the North Wind to carry it away to a place underground.</p>

<p>133. His fathers (<i>i.e.</i>, the gods) looked on, they rejoiced, they were
glad.</p>

<p>134. They brought unto him offerings of triumph and peace,</p>

<p>135. The Lord [Marduk] paused, he examined Tiâmat's carcase.</p>

<p>136. He separated flesh [from] hair,<a href="#fn40"><sup>40</sup></a> he worked cunningly.</p>

<p>137. He slit Tiâmat open like a flat (?) fish [cut into] two pieces,</p>

<p>138. The one half he raised up and shaded the heavens therewith,</p>

<p>139. He pulled the bolt, he posted a guard,</p>

<p>140. He ordered them not to let her water escape.</p>

<p>141. He crossed heaven, he contemplated the regions thereof.</p>

<p>142. He betook himself to the abode of Nudimmud (Ea) that is opposite
to the Deep (Apsu),</p>

<p>143. The Lord Marduk measured the dimensions of the Deep,</p>

<p>144. He founded E-Sharra, a place like unto it,</p>

<p>145. The abode E-Sharra, which he made to be heaven.</p>

<p>146. He made the-gods Anu, Bel and Ea to inhabit their [own] cities.</p>

<p>4. He set up for the twelve months three stars apiece.</p>

<p>7. That none might exceed or fall short.</p>

<p>8. He set the Station of Bel and Ea thereby.</p>

<p>9. He opened great gates under shelter on both sides.</p>

<p>10. He made a strong corridor on the left and on the right.</p>

<p>11. He fixed the zenith in the heavenly vault (?)</p>

and committed the night to his care.</p>

<p>13. He set him for the government of the night, to determine the day</p>

<p>14. Monthly, without fail, he set him in a crown (<i>i.e.</i>, disk)
[saying]:</p>

<p>15. "At the beginning of the month when thou risest over the land,</p>

<p>16. "Make [thy] horns to project to limit six days [of the month]</p>

but they seem to have described further acts of Creation.]</p>

<p>75. The gods, his (Marduk's) fathers, looked on the net which he had
made,</p>

<p>76. They observed how craftily the bow had been constructed,</p>

<p>77. They extolled the work which he had done.</p>

<p>78. [Then] the god Anu lifted up [the bow] in the company of the gods,


79. He kissed the bow [saying]: "That ..."</p>

<p>80. He proclaimed [the names] of the bow to be as follows:--</p>

<p>81. "Verily, the first is 'Long Wood,' the second is ...</p>

<p>82. "Its third name is 'Bow Star in heaven' ..."</p>

<h3>SIXTH TABLET.</h3>

<p>1. On hearing the words of the gods, the heart of Marduk moved him to
carry out the works of a craftsman.</p>

<p>2. He opened his mouth, he spake to Ea that which he had planned in
his heart, he gave counsel [saying]:</p>

<p>3. "I will solidify blood, I will form bone.</p>

<p>4. "I will set up man, 'Man' [shall be] his name.</p>

<p>5. "I will create the man 'Man.'</p>

<p>6. "The service of the gods shall be established, and I will set them
(<i>i.e.</i>, the gods) free.</p>

<p>7. "I will make twofold the ways of the gods, and I will beautify
[them].</p>

<p>8. "They are [now] grouped together in one place, but they shall be
partitioned in two."<a href="#fn41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>9. Ea answered and spake a word unto him</p>

<p>10. For the consolation of the gods<a href="#fn42"><sup>42</sup></a> he repeated unto him a word of
counsel [saying]:</p>

<p>11. "Let one brother [god of their number] be given, let him suffer
destruction that men may be fashioned.</p>

<p>12. "Let the great gods be assembled, let this [chosen] one be given
in order that they (<i>i.e.</i>, the other gods) may be established."</p>

<p>13. Marduk assembled the great gods, [he came near] graciously, he
issued a decree,</p>

<p>14. He opened his mouth, he addressed the gods; the King spake a word
unto the Anunnaki [saying]:</p>

<p>15. "Verily, that which I spake unto you aforetime was true.</p>

<p>16. "[This time also] I speak truth. [Some there were who] opposed
me.<a href="#fn43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>17. "Who was it that created the strife,</p>

<p>18. "Who caused Tiâmat to revolt, to join battle with me?</p>

<p>19. "Let him who created the strife be given [as sacrifice],</p>

<p>20. "I will cause the axe in the act of sinking to do away his sin."</p>

<p>21. The great gods, the Igigi, answered him,</p>

<p>22. Unto the King of the gods of heaven and of earth, the Prince of
the gods, their lord [they said]:</p>

<p>23. "[It was] Kingu who created the strife,</p>

<p>24. "Who made Tiâmat to revolt, to join battle [with thee]."</p>

<p>25. They bound him in fetters [they brought] him before Ea, they
inflicted punishment on him, they let his blood,</p>

<p>26. From his blood he (<i>i.e.</i>, Ea) fashioned mankind for the
service of the gods, and he set the gods free.</p>

<p>27. After Ea had fashioned man he ... laid service upon him.</p>

<p>28. [For] that work, which pleased him not, man was chosen: Marduk ...</p>

<p>29. Marduk, the King of the gods, divided ... he set the Anunnaki up
on high.</p>

<p>30. He laid down for Anu a decree that protected [his] heart ... as a
guard.</p>

<p>31. He made twofold the ways on the earth [and in the heavens?]


32. By decrees ...</p>

<p>33. The Anunnaki who ...</p>

<p>34. The Anunnaki ...</p>

<p>35. They spake unto Marduk, their lord, [saying]:</p>

<p>36. "O thou Moon-god<a href="#fn44"><sup>44</sup></a> (Nannaru), who hast established our splendour,</p>

<p>37. "What benefit have we conferred upon thee?</p>

<p>38. "Come, let us make a shrine, whose name shall be renowned;</p>

<p>[After line 53 the middle portions of several lines of text are
obliterated, but from what remains of it it is clear that the gods
partook of a meal of consecration of the shrine of E-Sagila, and then
proceeded to issue decrees. Next Marduk assigns seats to the Seven
Gods of Fate and to Enlil and Anu, and then he lays up in E-Sagila the
famous bow which he bore during his fight against Tiâmat. When the
text again becomes connected we find the gods singing a hymn of praise
to Marduk.]</p>

the text that remains that Lakhmu, and Lakhamu, and Anshar all

<h2>Notes.</h2>

<p>1. There are in the British Museum several fragments of Neo-Babylonian
copies of the Seven Tablets of Creation, the exact position of which
is at present uncertain. One of these (S. 2013) is of some importance
because it speaks of one object which was in the "upper Tiâmat"
<img src="images/c037.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />, and of another which was in the "lower Tiâmat"
<img src="images/c038.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" />. This shows that the Babylonians thought that one half of
the body of Tiâmat, which was split up by Marduk, was made into the
celestial ocean, and the other half into the terrestrial ocean, in
other words, into "the waters that were above" and "the waters that
were beneath" the firmament respectively.</p>

<p>2. When George Smith published his <i>Chaldean Account of Genesis</i>
in 1876, he was of opinion that the Creation Tablets in the British
Museum contained descriptions of the Temptation of Eve by the serpent
and of the building and overthrow of the Tower of Babel.  The
description of Paradise in Genesis ii seems to show traces of
Babylonian influence, and the cylinder seal, Brit. Mus. No. 89,326,
was thought to be proof that a Babylonian legend of the Temptation
existed. In fact, George Smith printed a copy of the seal in his book
(p. 91). But it is now known that the tablet which was believed to
refer to man's eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge (K. 3, 473
+ 79-7-8, 296 + R. 615) describes the banquet of the gods to which
they invited Marduk. In like manner the text on K. 3657, which Smith
thought referred to the Tower of Babel, is now known to contain no
mention of a tower or building of any sort. It was also thought by him
that K. 3364 contained a set of instructions which God gave to Adam
and Eve after their creation, but it is now known and admitted by all
Assyriologists that the text on this tablet contains moral precepts
and has nothing to do with the Creation Series. Enquiries are from
time to time made at the Museum for tablets which deal with the
Temptation of Eve, and the destruction of the Tower of Babel, and the
Divine commands to Adam and Eve; it is perhaps not superfluous to say
that nothing of the kind exists.</p>

abyss of waters from out of which the world was called. It was, more
probably, a ceremonial object used in the cult of the god, something

distinguished a portion of the heavens by the name of "Khat Nut," "the

first shows an oval object rimmed with stars and the other a

her Allies represent the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. When Marduk
destroyed Tiâmat and her associates, he found it necessary to fix the
stars, the images of the great gods, in their places, as the Twelve
Signs of the Zodiac. (See the Fifth Tablet of Creation, p. 55.)</p>

<a name="fn31"></a>
<p>31. <i>i.e.</i>, "let what thou sayest prevail."</p>

<a name="fn32"></a>
<p>32. <i>I.e.</i>, the destruction of Tiâmat.</p>

<a name="fn33"></a>
<p>33. <i>I.e.</i>, the establishing of a new creation to take
the place of the old.</p>

<a name="fn34"></a>
<p>34. The meaning of <img src="images/c033.png" alt="[Cuneiform]" /> <i>pal-a</i> is unknown.</p>

<a name="fn35"></a>
<p>35. This equipment of the charioteer is shown on the
bas-reliefs.</p>

<a name="fn36"></a>
<p>36. Compare Psalms xviii, 7-15; civ, i ff.</p>

<a name="fn37"></a>
<p>37. <i>I.e.</i>, the gods were impatient to begin the fight.</p>

<a name="fn38"></a>
<p>38. By impressing his seal on the Tablet Marduk proved his
ownership of the Tablet, and made his claim to it legal.</p>

<a name="fn39"></a>
<p>39. This is an oblique way of saying that Marduk succeeded
where Ea failed.</p>

<a name="fn40"></a>
<p>40. The word is <i>kupu</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, "reed" or "sedge."
It is possible that Marduk skinned Tiâmat.</p>

<a name="fn41"></a>
<p>41. Reading, <i>ishtenish lu kuppudu-ma ana shina lu
uzizu</i>.</p>

<a name="fn42"></a>
<p>42. <i>I.e.</i>, "to cause the gods to be content,"</p>

<a name="fn43"></a>
<p>43. Literally "they (indefinite) opposed me."</p>

<a name="fn44"></a>
<p>44. See <i>Cuneiform Texts</i>, Part XXIV, Plate 50, where it
is said that the god Sin is "Marduk, who maketh bright the night."</p>

<a name="fn45"></a>
<p>45. Lines 44 and 45 announce Marduk's determination to build
Babylon.</p>

<a name="fn46"></a>
<p>46. This is the word commonly used for "temple-tower." The
famous ziggurat of E-Sagila here mentioned was built in Seven Stages
or Steps, each probably having its own distinctive colour. It was
destroyed probably soon after the capture of Babylon by Cyrus (539
B.C.) and when Alexander the Great reached Babylon he found it ruins.</p>

<a name="fn47"></a>
<p>47. This is the first known mention of the "horns" of a
ziggurat, and the exact meaning of the word is doubtful.</p>

<a name="fn48"></a>
<p>48. From this text it seems clear that Up-shukkinaku was the
name of a chamber in the temple of E-Sagila. This name probably means
the "chamber of the shakkanaku," <i>i.e.</i>, the chamber in which the
governor of the city (<i>shakkanaku</i>) went annually to embrace the
hands of the god Bel-Marduk, from whom he thereby received the right
of sovereignty over the country.</p>

<a name="fn49"></a>
<p>49. This line seems to imply that Marduk was regarded as the
instructor of the "old" gods; the allusion is, probably, to the "ways"
of Anu, Bel and Ea, which are treated as technical terms in
astrology.</p>

<a name="fn50"></a>
<p>50. Here the title "Black-headed" refers to all mankind, but
it is sometimes used by the scribes to distinguish the population of
the Euphrates Valley from foreign peoples of light complexions.</p>

<a name="fn51"></a>
<p>51. Compare the language of the Kur'ân (Surah II, v. 256),
"He (Allah) knoweth what is before them and what is behind them."</p>

<a name="fn52"></a>
<p>52. These lines suggest that the fight between Marduk and
Tiâmat was recurrent; it is incorrect to translate the verbal forms as
preterites.</p>

<a name="fn53"></a>
<p>53. "To open the ears" -- to give understanding.</p>

<a name="fn54"></a>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
